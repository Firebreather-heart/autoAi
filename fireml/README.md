# autoML
simple module and added application to automatically create and test your data for models that will best fit, then you can fine tune it further.
what i'm trying to build is simple, i want to create an app, along with a python module that will automatically create AI models on any given data, automatically 
detect the kind of data, decide if its a reg task or not, then build the best models for the data, and give the user recommendations
on how to further train the best model....bla bla bla...
